#Important
All of the bindings, except those for libtcod and FreeGLUT, have been migrated to [DerelictOrg](https://github.com/DerelictOrg). The Derelict 3 repository will be left as-is, but I will no longer be maintaining it. If you are using Derelict 3, switching to DerelictOrg should largely be painless. For the most part, you shouldn't need to change anything in your code to do so. So please make the switch! Thank you.

#Derelict 3

I will continue to accept pull requests here in this repository only for bug fixes. No new packages will be accepted. I will leave it online indefinitely so that those who are using it can continue to do so. However, this repository will be considered deprecated once all of the packages have been migrated. I highly encourage that all new projects, or any that can easily transtion, make use of the new repositories. Thanks!

###Building
Download the sources, either as a [zip](https://github.com/aldacron/Derelict3/archive/master.zip) or via git e.g. ```git clone https://github.com/aldacron/Derelict3.git```

Where ```$Derelict``` is the path of the Derelict directory:
```
cd $Derelict/build
dmd build.d

# Build all Derelict packages
build

# Build specific packages.
build Util GL3

# Package names are case insensitive
build util gl3
```

##Documentation

Work on documenting Derelict is in process here at the [project wiki](https://github.com/aldacron/Derelict3/wiki). As more documentation is written, this README is going to shrink!

##Status

Currently, Derelict can be considered to be in BETA. It is perfectly usable as-is and has been battle-tested pretty well. Only the lack of documentation is preventing me from calling this a "release". Pull requests for bugfixes and enhancements are extremely welcome. However, I make no promises about accepting pull requests that add new packages. I'll have to take a wait-and-see approach on that for now.


##Older Versions

#####Major changes from 2 -> 3
Several things have changed from Derelict 2.

The first thing to notice is that all source modules are located under a single import tree. When you build, .di files are no longer generated. So when building your app, you can just put the 'import' folder on the compiler's import path and away you go.

Second, Derelict is now D2 only. You should still be able to use Tango with Derelict via the recently announced D2 port. But if you need D1, go back to Derelict 2.

Third, the build process has changed. No more makefiles. I hate them with a passion. The decision to support D2-only made it practical to slap together a simple build script. See [here](#build)


##A Few Special Notes

###Freeglut
This is a binding to [freeglut 2.8.0](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/). It is largely complete, however it's missing the types for the font stuff. In the C headers, the font types are declared in a manner that I find a bit confusing. I need to dig into it a bit more to figure out exactly how to implement them on the D side.


###Freetype
This is a binding to [freetype 2.4](http://www.freetype.org/). For Windows, there are some binaries available for download from external links off the FreeType site, but those are for older versions and will not load out of the box. You'll definitely need to download and compile the latest 2.4.x version.

###OpenGL3
None of the symbols deprecated in the modern OpenGL specifications are present. This binding is based solely on the C header, gl3.h. You can still use older versions of OpenGL, but none of the deprecated functions will be loaded.

Here's what you need to do in order to get up and running.

Using a third party lib (like GLFW 3, for which you can use DerelictGLFW3 in this repo):
```d
// One import -- this pulls in all OpenGL core 1.1 - 4.2
// functions & types as well as the ARB extensions.
import derelict.opengl3.gl3;

// Use GLFW 3 to create a forward-compatible core context
import derelict.glfw3.glfw3;

void someFunc()
{

// Load the OpenGL library and all functions up to OpenGL 1.1. It is not strictly
// necessary to load this before creating a context, unless you need to call some
// system-specific functions from the OpenGL shared library during context creation.
// You could call further below, just before the reload function. I prefer to load
// all of my shared libraries first so that I can fail early if they are not available.
DerelictGL3.load();

// Create your (preferably forward-compatible) OpenGL context
...

// Now load OpenGL versions 1.2 & higher as well as ARB extensions
// Note that no platform-specific extensions and no extensions
// other than ARB are implemented at the moment.
GLVersion glver = DerelictGL3.reload();

// If you need a specific version, like OpenGL3.3 for example
if(glver < GLVersion.GL33)
    throw new Exception("OpenGL version too low.");

// Or use the loadedVersion property
if(DerelictGL3.loadedVersion < GLVersion.GL33)
    ...

// To test if an extenstion is loaded, just use the extension name as a bool value
if(!ARB_sync)
   throw new Exception("No ARB_sync extension!");

}
```

You should call reload anytime you change contexts. This is required on Windows, but not on other platforms. There's a little bit more to do if you want to create a context yourself, but there's no support for that right now as I haven't yet implemented the WGL extensions.

Furthermore, you can also make deprecated functions and constants available like so:

```d
import derelict.opengl3.gl;

void someFunc()
{
    DerelictGL.load();

    // create classic, or compatible context

    DerelictGL.reload();
}
```

Notice that you are using the DerelictGL object, not the DerelictGL3 object in this case. You still need to link DerelictGL3.lib, as the DerelictGL stuff is compiled into the same library since it's part of the same package.

###Tcod
This is a binding to [libtcod 1.5.1](http://doryen.eptalys.net/libtcod). Everything from libtcod is there with one major caveat. libtcod exports color structs from the shared library by value. This is no problem when linking with an import lib on windows or directly with the shared object on posix systems, but when loading manually like Derelict does it's rather problematic. libtcod provides some special functions, declared in "wrapper.h" for wrappers and bindings to work around the issue, but that means using integer values rather than the struct to represent colors. However, I chose to take a different route. DerelictTCOD loads the colors in the same way it loads the functions keep them stored as pointers. It would be possible to instead write a wrapper function that pulls the value from the pointer and copies it into the Derelict address space. But rather than do that sort of pointless duplication, I just kept them as pointers. In D, after all, you access members of a struct pointer in the same way you do a non-pointer. The only difference is that when you call one of the many TCOD_color* functions that expect a color struct to be passed by value and want to pass it one of the stock colors, you have to use the * operator on the color instance, like so:

```D
auto color = TCOD_color_subract(*TCOD_white, *TCOD_red);
```
